## 2025 Recap Scene
The 2025 Recap Scene includes scenes of rectangles that display quantifiable data, that being grades, hours slept per night, screen time in hours, workout sessions per week, and new skills learned. Conditionally some text may be shown if you have high grades or learned a lot of skills.
## 2026 Goals Scene
The 2026 Goals Scene includes some stuff that I've done in january which is being read from a text file, and also displays the amount of late assignments I've had so far this year and the amount of books I've read. These display goals that mean I will try not to turn in assignments late and I will also read more books.
